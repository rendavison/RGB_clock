##RGB Clock is a small Jekyll project that uses JS and SCSS to convert the current time to an RGB value.

## TODO:
- make the RGB changing work
- make the radio buttons less ugly
- make the site remember if you want 12h or 24h between refreshes
- add two RGB modes?
- one "classic" that jumps when 59 flips to 00
- one "modern" that is smooth throughout the 24 hours
